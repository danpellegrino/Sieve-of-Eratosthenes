# Sieve of Eratosthenes Visualization

This program implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers and visually displays them using an HTML canvas.

## Description

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm that efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a given limit. This program utilizes the algorithm and provides a graphical representation of the generated prime numbers in a grid-like format.
## Features

- Generates prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
- Displays the prime numbers in a grid format using an HTML canvas.
- Responsive design adapts to different window resolutions.
- User-friendly interface with a number input for defining the limit.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a number in the input field to define the limit for generating prime numbers.
3. Press the "Generate" button to initiate the algorithm and display the prime numbers on the canvas.
4. The canvas will resize dynamically to fit the window size, ensuring full visibility of the grid.
5. Explore the generated prime numbers visually on the canvas.
